# Magonia Research - Detection Contents & IOCs

Welcome to the **Magonia Research** GitHub repository. This organization is dedicated to publishing detection content, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and research related to cybersecurity threats. Our focus is on network forensics, malware analysis, and advanced threat detection methodologies.

## 🔍 About Magonia Research

Magonia Research is committed to improving cyber threat detection by leveraging cutting-edge methodologies in network metadata analysis and similarity hashing techniques. We publish:
- **Detection Rules & Threat Signatures**: Zeek scripts, Suricata rules, and other detection content.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Known malicious IPs, hashes, domains, and network behaviors.
- **Threat Intelligence Research**: Reports on emerging threats and adversary tactics.
- **TLSH-Based Malware Research**: Work on **TLSH (Trend Locality-Sensitive Hashing)** for malware clustering and detection.

## 🛠 Ongoing Research: TLSH for Malware Similarity Analysis

One of our key areas of research is using **TLSH** for identifying malware variants and attack toolkits. This involves:
- Developing **a LimaCharlie extension** for TLSH-based scanning.
- Building **a stateless TLSH distance-measuring service** for rapid malware correlation.
- Experimenting with **TLSH clustering** to improve automated threat detection pipelines.
